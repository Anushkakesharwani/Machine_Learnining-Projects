### Machine Learning Projects
*	CTC Prediction: Developed a salary prediction model for newly hired employees at TechWorks Consulting to streamline compensation planning. Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical features, selecting relevant attributes such as experience and previous CTC.
*	Loan Default Prediction: Analyzed a loan dataset by preprocessing data, including handling missing values and applying one-hot encoding. This project trains and evaluates multiple classification models to effectively predict loan outcome.
*	Predicted Food Delivery Outcomes: Analyzed the Online Foods dataset by preprocessing the data and applying machine learning techniques. The project trains and evaluates various classification models to effectively predict food delivery outcomes.
*	# House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices using regression techniques including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression.

## Project Overview
- Performed data cleaning: handled missing values and outliers
- Engineered new features such as average distance from landmarks
- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding
- Built and evaluated models using MSE, RMSE, and R² metrics
- Compared model performances and analyzed feature importance

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install required libraries (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to reproduce results

## Results
Linear Regression achieved the best performance with the highest R² and lowest RMSE, while Ridge and Lasso helped with regularization and feature selection.
