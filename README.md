## 🏠 House Price Prediction  
Developed regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso) to predict house prices.  
- Handled missing values, treated outliers  
- Engineered features like average distance from landmarks  
- One-hot encoded categorical variables  
- Evaluated models using MSE, RMSE, and R²  
📈 *Linear Regression gave the best performance overall*

## 💼 CTC Prediction  
Built a salary prediction model for new hires at TechWorks Consulting.  
- Cleaned data and handled missing values  
- Encoded categorical features  
- Focused on variables like experience and previous CTC  
📊 *Streamlined compensation planning using regression models*

## 🏦 Loan Default Prediction  
Created models to predict whether a loan would default.  
- Preprocessed data and applied one-hot encoding  
- Trained multiple classification models  
- Evaluated performance using classification metrics  
🧮 *Helped assess loan risks effectively*
